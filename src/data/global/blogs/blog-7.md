Creative jobs website and networking platform The Dots has launched the “bias blocker”, a new browsing mode that stops employers being able to see candidates’ photos, names, education and employment history, on the basis that they should be judged on the “quality of their work” only. Will tools like this help to build a more diverse design workforce?

Regardless of our gender, race, religion, cultural beliefs or education, all of us are biased in some way. This no doubt seeps into recruitment – whether we are subconsciously looking for people we relate to, or we are actively going against this to try to diversify the workplace, personal feelings and opinion are making their way into the hiring process.

Positive discrimination – giving an advantage to those from minority backgrounds or discriminated groups to put them on a level playing field with others – can only be a good thing. It increases the diversity of people, and therefore the diversity of ideas, in the workplace.
